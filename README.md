# TerminEK event plugin for WordPress #

This is a plugin for WordPress. Once installed it adds the possibility to add posts of an "event" type that can have start- and enddates assigned to them. These events can be displayed in an archive sorted by starting date. You can choose to display only events that take place in the future or only passed events. 

## Functionality ## 

After installing you will be able to create and manage events by clicking on the "Events" tab. Under "Settings" there will be a tab "Event options" where you can configure display options for your events.

## Installation ##

Download the repository and copy the folder to the folder plugins inside the folder wp-content of your wordpress installation. Then navigate to the tab "plugins" in your WordPress admin backend and activate the plugin.
